## THIS FORK OF ACK IS NOT INTENDED FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION

The changes in this fork are solely for the purpose of better integration with [AckMate](http://github.com/protocool/AckMate) and they will not be merged into the upstream 'official' release of ack.

Pull requests will be refused unless they deal specifically with AckMate integration. 

In particular, changes that add support for new filetypes should be directed at [http://github.com/petdance/ack](http://github.com/petdance/ack) as they will not be applied here.
